2. How to run Test Code on CLI
  - From the Root Directory of this project, type the command below. 
  ```bash
  $ pwd
  ~/ruby_notification_work   ####check if here's on Root dir on the project. 
  $ ruby run_test.rb
  ```

  ```bash
  Loaded suite run_test
  Started

  - at the Case Above, 6 assertion checks were executed and all passed. 
  - If you want to add new test cases, you may write the test cases as hash in ruby_notification_work/test/test_case.rb


# Assumptions 

1. Only NotificationType 1,2,3 are considered to the output. (Since other number of NotificationType is not defined, skip these elements.)   
2. TimeStamp 
    * All the events Are sorted by timestamp(13 digits) values by ascending order. 
        * e.g  value of timestamp1 is 10, value of  timestamp2 is 20. Though both timestamps have the same date time when Converted( [1970-01-01 08:00:00] ), sorting them by timestamp ascending order.
    * Timestamp has unique value for every event. (So, didn’t consider the stable sort when sorting the timestamps).
    * Set the default time zone as SGT(Singapore Time). So it would always print out the output based on SGT date time. 
3. When Merging the Notifications, there would not be over 3 notifications duplicated(Set the max allowed numbers of merged as a variable on the Model, which can be changed.) So, In the case that over 3 Notifications, skip the Remainders, which shows recent 3 senders on message by time descending order.
